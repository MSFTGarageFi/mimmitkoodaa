# Intro to Web Development 

Let’s take a first few steps into web application development!

In the following exercises we will cover:
-	What is front end, and how do you use HTML and Javascript to build it?
-	What is back end, why do you need it and how does Javascript end up there as well?
-	Why you will fall in love with packages, and APIs.
-	How do you pull it all together to make something that hasn’t existed before.

By the end of the day you will have created your first fully functional web application, with user interface and functioning back end. 

Notice that this is not the ultimate guide to web development, Node.js and Express, but rather a few simple exercises to help you understand some key parts of web development. We won't be discussing syntax, semicolons, protocols, ssl, standards and other topics in detail but rather give you a "hello world on steroids".
